       15 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,  16 “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” 17 The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.  -Exodus 1:15-17
My dad, who is pastor, was likely teaching a sermon about Moses. It might have been a Mother's Day sermon and tribute to his mother and her courage and then he talked about the midwives in Egypt. I know that this particular verse (Exodus 1:17) he highlighted during the sermon has stuck with me to this day. It is truly amazing how much substance there is to the Word of God. You can truly always get something new out of it. The Word of God is living!
We live in society where there are so many demands placed on us. We have worldly authorities and Godly authorities. God wants us to obey the authorities placed above us. However, evil lurks the Earth and the confusion we witness is often the result of spiritual battles we cannot see.  This brings chaos that God never intended but will sometimes allow for a time.  In the end, we must be willing to be obedient to God above all other authorities.
I often hear of Christians talking about what is right and wrong in America in terms of politics. "I'm a Christian, so I am a conservative not a liberal," some might say.  But I venture to say that no political view is unflawed. The only view that isn't flawed is the viewpoint of  Jesus Christ, which we live to emulate. Jesus is not a Democrat. He's not Republican. There's no such thing as a "biblical party."  Therefore, our focus shouldn't be on conforming to a political party but a desire to serve God by doing what is right.  Any figure in authority has flaws but we are to submit so long as they are operating in righteousness. We cannot just define righteousness by the sins we only choose to acknowledge. Sin is sin.  The slave trade is an example of sin that was done by the wrong doing of authority in this country. There was nothing to pray it about in deciding to go against it. It was clearly wrong. If my ancestors had chosen to stay silent toward the unrighteousness of authorities in America, I would not be writing this blog at this very moment.
When we fear God, He can also guide us in the manner in which to go about standing for what is right.  A good idea can be tainted when gone about in the wrong way. Our goal is never to convert anyone, only the Holy Spirit can move the heart. Our job is to impact.  We need to remember the midwives in ancient Egypt and fear God. When we know something is wrong, we must never comply. God will go with good courage (Joshua 1:9).</p>
<p>18 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” 19 The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” -Exodus 1:18-19
When you stand against the "normal," confrontation is inevitable. Our job is to stand on the Word of God. These midwives are a marvelous example for us. They told Pharaoh that Hebrew women were not like the Egyptian women. They Hebrew women were strong and healthy and gave birth before they could even be reached by the midwives.  We can apply that even today. We are not like unbelievers who do not have the Hand of God in their lives.  We do things that other people would think is impossible but we know it is truly the glory of God that gives us the power to do great things.
20 So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.  -Exodus 1:20-21</p>
<p>God blessed the midwives because their actions spared some Hebrews, the people of God. They feared His authority more than the king's. This is pleasing to God.  In this day, anyperson that chooses to be in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the their Lord and Savior is a part of the family. If we fear Him, we could be doing a great service, not just to ourselves, but to other members in the Household of Faith.  We are in this for the Kingdom, the greater good.  When it is painful, let us not forget the rewards that come with obeying God and that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10). No matter the circumstances, God's law is always right. Anything that contradicts it is wrong.</p>
